# Welcome to the DxMentorship Community ‚ôªÔ∏è

DxMentorship is a DevRel mentorship program dedicated to helping everyone skill up in developer relations. We do this by organizing mentorship cohorts where we train mentees on all things DevRel, we invite experts from the developer relations community to deliver sessions, answer questions, and share insights from their work experiences working at differenet companies.

The official website can be found on [Dxmentorship Website](dxmentorship.com). We also have a [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/dUQyb2mk4s) where we manage daily communications and activities.
